## AWS Glue Data Catalog Federation

AWS Glue Data Catalog federation enables you to link your external metastores to AWS Glue Data Catalog. This
eliminates the need to migrate your metastore into the AWS Glue Data Catalog in order to leverage other AWS services,
such as AWS Lake Formation, Amazon Athena, Amazon Redshift & Amazon EMR.

These are open-source base implementations of federation connectors. These connectors provide the necessary translation
layer between AWS Glue Data Catalog and your external metastore.

> Currently, only support external federation to the Apache Hive Metastore.
